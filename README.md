# 1000-German-Words

This Python scraper is designed to fetch data from [1000mostcommonwords](https://1000mostcommonwords.com/) using BeautifulSoup (bs4) and pandas. It compiles this data into a simple Excel document.

## Motivation
The collected data will be utilized in an upcoming project designed to assist German learners in practicing their language skills. This project will involve tasks such as translating English words to German and vice versa to enhance my German vocabulary. 

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to 1000mostcommonwords for providing the source data.
